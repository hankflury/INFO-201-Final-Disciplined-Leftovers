##WELCOME TO OUR AMAZING APPLICATION ABOUT EARTHQUAKES IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST :)

Some background info:
The dataset we're working with is a compilation of recorded earthquake statistics from the Pacific
Northwest Seismic Network (PNSN). This dataset ranges from 1969 to 2012, with information collected
from over 1000 recording stations. Hank Flury was exposed to this dataset while assisting a UW graduate
student model the earthquake statistics. While the data begins in 1969, the equipment used to collect the
information was somewhat archaic until 1970. It was based upon individuals calling in to report
earthquakes and then state on a scale of 1-10 how severe it was. From 1970 onwards, actual recording
equipment was utilized to collect the earthquake information.

Our targeted audience consists of anyone that has an interest in earthquakes within the Pacific Northwest.
This could include people residing locally, curious minds, or those looking to move to the PNW. Our
audience doesn't necessarily need to be scientists. We want the general laymen to be able to understand
our data. The three questions we want our audience to answer using our data are:

- What kind of earthquake statistics are available in relation to a specific latitude and
longitude, as well as time (so a user can interact with the data set and observe information
from their local area) ?
- What has been the frequency over time for these earthquakes? Have there been any
abnormally large or small frequency periods?
- Is there a correlation between depth and magnitude? As in, does depth appear to have an
impact on the magnitude, or the severity, of the seismic events?

The application consists of five different tabs!

- An introductory piece providing reasoning for why one would care about earthquake data. 
We're trying to make the information interesting and visually unique for the everday 
citizen!
- A page looking at earthquake occurrences across this time period (1970-2012) projected onto
a zoomable map with purple circles of varying sizes to represent earthquakes
- A page exlproing the relationship between depth and mangnitude by graphing individual earthquakes
onto a regression line with a 99% confidence bound (predicting magnitude based on depth)
- A page visualzing the frequency of earthquakes over time and space in the PNW. It's a density
graph that is 'filled', so if you took the integral of the area under the curve it would equal
1!
- A concluding page to address some closing thoughts while also providing credit to our
wonderful team!

**ALL of the visualizations/graphs are interactive! Enabling a user to see information dependent**
**on a specific latitude/longitude, magnitude, and time period!**

We hope you enjoy our app :)
